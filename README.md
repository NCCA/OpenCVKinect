![alt tag](http://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/GraphicsLib/Demos/OpenCV.png)

This demo shows how to use the kinect with the OpenKinect drivers and Qt / ngl. The code base is a modified version of my Qt Kinect Reference design which can be seen here. You will need to install the libfreenect drivers

This has issues on the mac due to the C++ compiler and OpenCV
